    "In October 2019, teams from Microsoft, Google and Facebook independently published three new transformer papers: [UniLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03197), [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) and [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461). All three papers found that they achieve better downstream performance on generation tasks, like translation and summarization, if they (a) replace BERT's bidirectional architecture with a Seq2Seq architecture and (b) BERT's fill-in-the blank  cloze task with a more complicated mix of pretraining tasks.\n",
