            "content": "Overview . For the past few weeks, I worked on integrating BART into transformers. This post covers the high-level differences between BART and its predecessors and how to use the new BartForConditionalGeneration to summarize documents. Enjoy and leave a comment below if you have any questions! . Background: Seq2Seq Pretraining . In October 2019, teams from Google and Facebook published new transformer papers: T5 and BART. Both papers achieved better downstream performance on generation tasks, like translation and summarization, with two changes: . replace BERT&#39;s bidirectional encoder architecture with an encoder-decoder architecture | replace BERT&#39;s fill-in-the blank cloze task with a more complicated mix of pretraining tasks. | . Now let&#39;s dig deeper into the big Seq2Seq pretraining idea! . Bert vs. GPT2 . As the BART authors write: . (BART) can be seen as generalizing Bert (due to the bidirectional encoder) and GPT2 (with the left to right decoder). . Bert is pretrained to try to predict masked tokens, and uses the whole sequence to get enough info to make a good guess. This is good for tasks where the prediction at position i is allowed to utilize information from positions after i, but less useful for tasks, like text generation, where te prediction for position i can only depend on previously generated words. . In code, the idea of &quot;what information you can use when predicting the token at position i&quot; is controlled by an argument called attention_mask1. A value of 1 in these examples means that the model can use information for the column&#39;s when predicting the row&#39;s word. . Here is Bert&#39;s &quot;Fully-visible&quot; attention_mask: . . . the same parameter that is used to make model predictions invariant to pad tokens.&#8617; . | GPT2, meanwhile, is pretrained to predict the next word using a causal mask: and is more effective for generation tasks, but less effective on downstream tasks where the whole input yields information for the output. . Here is the attention_mask for GPT2: . . Encoder-Decoder . Our new friends, like Bart, get the best of both worlds: . The encoder&#39;s attention_mask is bidirectional, like BERT: . and the decoder&#39;s attention_mask is causal, like GPT2: . . The encoder and decoder are connected by cross-attention, where each decoder layer performs attention over the final hidden state of the encoder output. This presumably nudges the models towards generating output that is closely connected to the original input. . Pretraining Task . Bart and T5 are both pretrained on tasks where spans of text are replaced by masked tokens, and the model must learn to reconstruct the original document. Figure 1 from the BART paper explains it well: . In this example, the original document is A B C D E. the span [C, D] is masked before encoding and an extra mask is inserted before B, leaving the corrupted document &#39;A _ B _ E&#39; as input to the encoder. . The decoder (autogressive means &quot;uses a causal mask&quot;) must reconstruct the original document, using the encoder&#39;s output and previous uncorrupted tokens. . Summarization . Now, we apply this Seq2Seq method to summarization, where the input sequence is the document we want to summarize, and the output sequence is a ground truth summary. The Seq2Seq attention pattern is therefore well suited to summarization and other conditional generation tasks. Seq2Seq models are allowed to attend to the whole input document, but, as they generate a summary, they can only consider what they&#39;ve already generated. The numbers confirm this: all the new fancy Seq2Seq models do a lot better than the old less-fancy guys on the CNN/Daily Mail abstractive summarization task, and Bart does especially well. . rouge2 model_size Pretraining . PT-Gen (not seq2seq) | 17.28 | 22 M | None | . TransformerAbs | 17.76 | 200M | None | . BertSumABS | 19.39 | 220 M | Encoder | . UniLM | 20.3 | 340 M | Seq2Seq | . T5-base | 20.34 | 770 M | Seq2Seq | . Bart | 21.28 | 406 M | Seq2Seq | . T5-11B | 21.55 | 11 B | Seq2Seq | . BertSumABS (from Text Summarization with Pretrained Encoders, uses a Seq2Seq architecture but doesn&#39;t pretrain the decoder. TransformerAbs, from the same paper, uses a slightly smaller model and no pretraining. | PT-Gen is from Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks | UniLM is a &quot;Prefix-LM&quot; with a similar masking strategy to Bart and T5. | .

The world No 4 is into the semi-finals of the Miami Open, but not be fore getting a scare from 21 year-old Austrian Dominic Thiem, who pushed him to 4-4 in the second set before going down 3-6 6-4, 6-1 in an hour and three quarte rs. Murray was awaiting the winner from the last eight match between Tomas Berdy ch and Argentina&#39;s Juan Monaco. Prior to this tournament Thiem lost in the secon d round of a Challenger event to soon-to-be new Brit Aljaz Bedene. Andy Murray p umps his first after defeating Dominic Thiem to reach the Miami Open semi finals . Muray throws his sweatband into the crowd after completing a 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 vi ctory in Florida . Murray shakes hands with Thiem who he described as a &#39;strong guy&#39; after the game . And Murray has a fairly simple message for any of his fell ow British tennis players who might be agitated about his imminent arrival into the home ranks: don&#39;t complain. Instead the British No 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world number 83, originally from Slovenia, a s motivation to better themselves. At present any grumbles are happening in priv ate, and Bedene&#39;s present ineligibility for the Davis Cup team has made it less of an issue, although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the International Tennis Federation. Murray thinks anyone questioning the move, now it has become official, would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his. &#39;If he was 500 in the world they wouldn&#39;t be that fussed about it but ob viously he threatens their position a bit,&#39; said the 27 year-old Scot. &#39; and he&#39; s obviously the British number two, comfortably. &#39;So they can complain but the b est thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is, and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not. He&#39;s British now so they&#39;ve just got to deal with it. Murray stretches for a return after starting h is quarter final match slowly on the show court . Thiem held nothing back as he raced through the opening set, winning it 6-3 with a single break . The young Au strian is considered to be one of the hottest prospects on the ATP Tour . &#39;I wou ld hope that all the guys who are below him now like James (Ward) , Kyle (Edmund ) , Liam (Broady) they will use it as motivation. If he becomes eligible for Dav is Cup then those guys are going to have to prove themselves. &#39;It can only be se en as a positive for those guys using it to try to get better. He&#39;s a good playe r but so are James and Kyle and Liam has improved. Aljaz is there, he&#39;s on the t our every week, the other guys aren&#39;t quite there yet.&#39; For the first time Murra y, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100, gave his opinion of Bedene : &#39;He&#39;s a good player with a very good serve. He&#39;s a legitimate top 100 player, when he plays Challengers he&#39;s there or thereabouts, when he plays on the main t our he wins matches, it&#39;s not like he turns up and always loses in the first rou nd. Murray&#39;s fiancee was once again watching from the stands shaded by a huge br immed hat . Kim Sears flashes her enormous diamond engagement ring while watchin g her beau on court . &#39;He had a bad injury last year (wrist) but has recovered w ell. I would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings although I don&#39;t know exactly how high he can go. I&#39;ve practised with him a couple of times, I haven&#39;t seen him play loads, but when you serve as well as he does it helps. I would im agine he&#39; s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while .&#39; It is understood the Lawn Tennis Association will give background support to his case regarding the Davis Cup but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way. An official statement said: &#39;To have another player in the men&#39; s top 100 is clearly a positive thing for British tennis and so we very much wel come Aljaz&#39;s change in citizenship.&#39; The last comparable switch came twenty year s ago when Greg Rusedski arrived from Canada. It was by no means universally pop ular but, like Bedene, he pledged that he was in for the long haul and, in fairn ess to him, he proved true to his word. Loising the first set shocked Murray int o life as he raced to a commanding lead in the second . The No 3 seed sent over a few glaring looks towards his team before winning the second set . Murray had to put such matters aside as he tackled the unusually talented Thiem, a delight to watch. Coached by Boris Becker&#39;s veteran mentor Gunter Bresnik, he slightly r esembles Andy Roddick and hits with similar power but more elegance. His single handed backhand is a thing of rare beauty. However, he has had a mediocre season coming into this event and there was little to forewarn of his glorious shotmak ing that seemed to catch Murray unawares early on. The world No 4 looked to have worked him out in the second, but then suffered one of his periopdic mental lap ses and let him back in from 4-1 before closing it out with a break. After break ing him for 3-1 in the decider the Austrian whirlwind burnt itself out. &#39;He&#39;s a strong guy who hits the ball hard and it became a very physical match,&#39; said Mur ray. Murray was presented with a celebratory cake after winning his 500th match in the previous round . &quot;&quot;&quot;.replace(&#39; n&#39;,&#39;&#39;) . . #collapse-show tokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained(&#39;bart-large-cnn&#39;) model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(&#39;bart-large-cnn&#39;) article_input_ids = tokenizer.batch_encode_plus([LONG_BORING_TENNIS_ARTICLE], return_tensors=&#39;pt&#39;, max_length=1024)[&#39;input_ids&#39;].to(torch_device) summary_ids = model.generate(article_input_ids, num_beams=4, length_penalty=2.0, max_length=140, min_len=55) summary_txt = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids.squeeze(), skip_special_tokens=True) display(Markdown(&#39;&gt; **Summary: **&#39;+summary_txt)) . . Summary: Andy Murray beat Dominic Thiem 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 in the Miami Open. The world No 4 is into the semi-finals of the tournament in Florida. Murray was awaiting the winner from the last eight match between Tomas Berdych and Argentina&#39;s Juan Monaco. Thiem lost in the second round of a Challenger event to Aljaz Bedene. . GPT2 (which in fairness is not finetuned for summarization) cannot really continue the tennis article sensically. . #collapse-show from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer gpt2_tok = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(&#39;gpt2&#39;) gpt2_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(&#39;gpt2&#39;, output_past=True) # truncate to 869 tokens so that we have space to generate another 155 enc = gpt2_tok.encode(LONG_BORING_TENNIS_ARTICLE, max_length=1024-155, return_tensors=&#39;pt&#39;) # Generate another 155 tokens source_and_summary_ids = gpt2_model.generate(enc, max_length=1024, do_sample=False) # Only show the new ones end_of_source = &quot;An official statement said:&quot; _, summary_gpt2 = gpt2_tok.decode(source_and_summary_ids[0]).split(end_of_source) display(Markdown(&#39;&gt; **GPT2:** &#39; + summary_gpt2)) . . GPT2: &#39;To have a player like James Ward, Kyle Edmund, Liam Broady and Aljaz Bedene in the top 100 is a huge achievement for the Lawn Tennis Association.

More importantly, these snippets show that even though BartForConditionalGeneration is a Seq2Seq model, while GPT2LMHeadModel is not, they can be invoked in similar ways for generation. . Conclusion . Our first release of BartModel prioritized moving quickly and keeping the code simple, but it&#39;s still a work in progress. I am currently working on making the implementation in transformers as fast and memory-efficient as the original implementation. Stay tuned for episode 2 of this series, where we try to close the gap. . A big thank you to Sasha Rush, Patrick Von Platten, Thomas Wolf, Clement Delangue, Victor Sanh, Yacine Jernite, Harrison Chase and Colin Raffel for their feedback on earlier versions of this post, and to the BART authors for releasing their code and answering questions on GitHub. .",

            "title": "Understanding Incremental Decoding",
            "content": "Here is a really slow (pseudocode) way to greedily generate summaries: . output_tokens = [bos] while not done: encoder_hidden_state = model.encoder(article_input_ids) logits = model.decoder(encoder_hidden_state, output_tokens) next_word = logits.argmax() output_tokens.append(next_word) if next_word == eos: break . Let&#39;s say N = len(article_input_ids) and M = len(output_tokens) when we return. Let&#39;s also ignore the cost of encoder-decoder attention. Then the complexity of this approach is roughly . $(N cdot M)$ (we call the encoder M times on N tokens) | $+ sum_{m=1}^{M} m = frac{M(M+1)}{2}$ (we call the decoder M times on 1 token then 2 tokens, all the way to M tokens). | Total: $N cdot M + frac{M(M+1)}{2}$ | . Let&#39;s say we are generating a 100 token summary of a 1024 token article, then we have to &quot;process&quot; $N cdot M + frac{M(M+1)}{2} = 107,450$ tokens . #collapse-hide # show work N,M=1024, 100 complexity_simple = int(N*M + ((M*(M+1))/2)) msg = &quot;To generate a 100 token summary of a 1024 token article using this approach, we have to process {:,} tokens.&quot; #display(Markdown(msg.format(complexity_simple))) . . Thankfully, we can just hoist the encoder call outside the loop! . output_tokens = [bos] encoder_hidden_state = model.encoder(article_input_ids) while not done: logits = model.decoder(encoder_hidden_state, output_tokens) next_word = logits.argmax() output_tokens.append(next_word) if next_word == eos: break . Now the complexity is dramatically reduced: $N cdot 1 + frac{M(M+1)}{2} = 6,074$ . But we can go even further, and partially cache the attention outputs for the decoder. This will change our generation loop to: . output_tokens = [bos] encoder_hidden_state = model.encoder(article_input_ids) cache = None while not done: logits, cache = model.decoder(encoder_hidden_state, output_tokens[-1], cache=cache) next_word = logits.argmax() output_tokens.append(next_word) if next_word == eos: break . And change our formula to $N + M = 1,124$ . The nitty-gritty of this trick is explained in the Bonus section below. . Partially caching keys and values in DecoderLayer . Here is some pseudocode for attention without all the reshapes and heads and masks and scaling. It doesn&#39;t work even though it looks pretty. . class SimplifiedAttention(nn.Module): def __init__(self, embed_dim): self.Wq = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim) self.Wk = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim) self.Wv = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim) self.dense = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim) def forward(self, query, key, value): q = self.Wq(q) k = self.Wk(k) v = self.Wv(v) matmul_qk = torch.matmul(q, k.T) attention_weights = matmul_qk.softmax(dim=-1) output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, v) return self.dense(output) . Now let&#39;s glimpse at the callers inside BART&#39;s DecoderLayer: (LayerNorms and dropouts deleted for simplicity). Here&#39;s some more pseudocode . class SimplifiedDecoderLayer(nn.Module): def __init__(self, embed_dim): self.self_attn = SimplifiedAttention(embed_dim) self.encoder_attn = SimplifiedAttention(embed_dim) def forward(x, last_encoder_hidden_state, *masks_etc): # x shape `(batch_size, tokens_generated_so_far, embed_dim)` # x comes from decoder x = self.self_attn(query=x, key=x, value=x) # pay attention to somebody else for a change! output = self.encoder_attn( query=x, key=last_encoder_hidden_state, # could be None value=last_encoder_hidden_state, ) return output . What did we learn? . In encoder_attention, we can cache everything that doesn&#39;t depend on q, namely these outputs k = self.Wk(k) v = self.Wv(v) . | . The more exciting optimization is that in self_attn, we can cache the part of k,v that depends on x[:, :1] the tokens we&#39;ve already generated. Then each time through the generation loop, we only pass in x[:, :-1] and apply concatenation: . k = torch.cat((past_key, new_k), dim=&#39;seq_len&#39;) # the seq_len dimension, v = torch.cat((past_value, new_v), dim=&#39;seq_len&#39;) . Of the 8 F.linear ops performed by each DecoderLayer, we&#39;ve managed to completely cache 2 of them, and almost completely cache 2 more. Overall, we chop off about 40% of the runtime vs only caching encoder_outputs. .",
